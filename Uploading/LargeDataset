Uploading dataset

Copyright (c) 2018 Maptec admin

The most common method of getting spatial data into Geonode is to upload shapefiles. 
The drawback is that shapefiles are very poor at holding and transporting large quantities of spatial data and tabular data has many restrictions. 
Preference should be to utilize PostgreSQL/PostGIS database along with QGIS to upload large datasets.

My preferred methods and sequence:   [consider generalizing data first, try http://mapshaper.org/]
  [Loading the Style first simplifies many things later]
1. Load data in QGIS 3.0
2. Style data and save as .sld style file.
3. Login to geoserver [your_geonode_ip]/geoserver
4. Go to Styles --> Add a new style
5. Give new style a name, preferrable the same exact name as the data you will upload later
6. Click on Choose File
7. Navigate to your saved style from step #2, click Open
8. Click on Upload ...
9. Recheck name from step #5, uploading may have overwritten it
10. Click Validate, correct any errors
11. Click Submit
12. In QGIS go to Processing Toolbox, search for Import to PostGIS
  [the following steps require you to have a PostGIS database already configured and running]
13. In the Import to PostGIS select preconfigured database
14. Click Run in Background to upload data 
  [upload time can be many hours for large datasets]
